Excel File Kinematic Analysis.xlsx is where we first logged data and took first numerical derivatives
accAnalysisFiltered.mat is results of Kinematics.mlx file
datacode.m is there for converting excel files into matlab code, we saved these datas onto KinematicData.mat file
accfilter.mat is result of filtering in data_plotting.mlx
matrixForm.mlx is for dynamical analysis, it's results are in DynamicalData.mat file
lastly we obtained final graphs from draw_results.mlx
